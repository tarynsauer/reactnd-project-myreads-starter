# MyReads Project

This book tracking app is forked from the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. It allows users to search for and organize books that they are currently reading, want to read, and have read.

## Getting Started

To start the app:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

### TODOs
* add tests
* swap out the starter template's backend server, [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js), with Google Books API.
